/*  
  So here lets examine what is going on so we learned why borderbox is an important tool 
  to use the first thing that we need to know is that we are setting the margin to 0 
  the padding to 0 and the boxsizing to borderbox to all of them we created three div tags 
  and then gave them each a class we then specieded what type of box we want and added 
  padding to the first and third one the logic is important to understand that this is going 
  to overllap each other like each box because the box will be more than 200 by 200 instead 
  the box will be 240 by 240 so what borderbox does is that it decrease the box size to 200 
  by 200 so that it stays in the frame and dont overlap
