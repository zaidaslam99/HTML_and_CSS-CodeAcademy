/* BORDER */

h1 {

  padding: 20px;
  margin: 30px;

  /* Different style border */
  border-bottom-style: dashed;
  border-bottom-width: 5px;
  border-bottom-color: aqua;

  /* border-style: solid;
  border-width: 10px;
  border-color: aqua; */
}
p {
  background: blue;

  /* We can write all at once */

/*  
  So here we are working with the border the thing that we need to know is that 
  its simple we can state the border width and then the border color we can change the 
  border style and even modify a part of the border it can be bottom style width and color 
  what this is going to do is modify the bottom half of the border the second thing that we 
  are doing the second thing that we are doing is we can create the border then the solid 
  and color all at once so its more easier to write so to recap its important to understand 
  the concept that background is blue then its going to be the padding which is going to be 
  all around the background and then the border which in this case its going to be all 
  around and then its going to be margin in this case the offset value and its important to 
  understand that margin works outside of border
