<!-- So here the first thing that we need to know is that we are going to be using the results.html
    with the index.html that is going to be linked back to this page so we are going to be using the 
    form tag in it we have the action that is linked to the results.html we talked about get and post 
    what I remmber here is that get is used to get data while post is used to post to the servers we 
    created many div the first div that we are doing is getting the label and then its getting the 
    input type important to understand that type is for html so it can pull up that type of modification 
    to the input so when it comes to name this is used to sort the data and the id is used to target 
    what we are trying to correlate to in this case the name and the other thing that we are doing is 
    using required what this does is that the user is programmed to fit the information in same logic 
    applies using email same goes for age the only thing to understand is that the type is changing 
    we can specify the min the max and step up when it comes to checkbox the thing that we need to know 
    here is that all that we can do is check them when it comes to radio it means we can select one button 
    only we can put multiuple options using the multiple keyword we then have text area which is going to 
    be getting the text so we can fill it out the file one is to input files and the phone one is to input 
    phone number when it comes to the color that is rarely used then when it comes to password its 
    basically to store the passwrod
