<!--  
    So here lets examine what is going on the first thing that we need to know is this that 
    we talked about css element and how we can change them we understood patterns something 
    else that we need to know is the format its written in object point of view the first 
    thing that we are doing is we are using the style tag and then we are using the h1 tag 
    and the h2 tag and essentially what we are doing is that we are creating a space for the 
    tag that we want manipluate and we then are changing it for all of them this is better 
    then using inline because what we do is going to be doing for all the reference tags 
    that is something to be aware of here. The other thing to be aware of here is this that 
    there is a draw back to doing this say we are using the about page and we have the same 
    thing done instead what we are doing is we are going to be going and changing the tags 
    for each subset group now imagine if there were many other files each having their own 
    style elements it would be a hassle to judge a group
