/*  
  So here lets examine what is going on the first thing that we need to know is that we are
  working with many different div and in there we have different class something that we are 
  doing here is that in everything we set the margin to 0 padding to 0 then borderbox is set 
  when it comes to box sizing the thing that we are learning s that in our div we put the float 
  to the left and the height of the float is set to 200px and width is set to 33 percent when it 
  comes to each class what we do is we change the background to a specfic color and as far as the 
  h1 we are using the clear and what this does is that it clears it to a new line like how we talked 
  about
