/* 
    So this is called grouping selectors the thing that we need to take 
    away from here is that we can use this naming convention called body 
    and then change one of the color and the other two what we are doing is 
    that we are getting the first heading and the second heading and then 
    we are changing it to blue while the body we are going to be changing it 
    to red that is something to be aware of here
